Now version 1 is we will have a hireachy that is the app.js is the root component. and the ExpenseItem component of reactJS will be child of app.js

App.js will have all the expense details which will be passed to expenseItem, ExpenseItem is kind of a temlate which can be reused again n again " <ExpenseItem/>


Now the date of expense can be formed another reactjs component, and this component is a child of ExpenseItem component 


So in short 

app.js ( root component)
    |
ExpenseItem
    |
ExpenseDate
